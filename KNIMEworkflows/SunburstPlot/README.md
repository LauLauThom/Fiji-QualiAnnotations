# Visualizing data-distribution using Sunburst chart
This workflow takes as input an annotation table as generated by the list-of-choices plugin.  
Refer to the documentation in the workflow for more details.

__Supplementary Figure 2: Visualizing data-distribution using sunburst charts in KNIME.__   
__(Top)__: The workflow counts the occurrence for each combination of features occurring in the dataset. The number of samples with a particular combination of qualitative features is reported in the column “Sum”. Here the table depicts the occurrence for the annotations of the table in Figure 3 (see article).  
__(Bottom)__: Resulting sunburst chart with each qualitative feature represented as a concentric circle. The concentric order of the feature circles (inner to outer) can be adapted by the user. The sunburst chart allows to compare the data-distribution for qualitative features, and to identify trends between features. For instance, the highlighted portion shows that all specimens with smooth appearance also have a circular shape, and most of them a rather dark pigmentation.
